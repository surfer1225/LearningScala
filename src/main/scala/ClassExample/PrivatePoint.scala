/*
In this version of the Point class, the data is stored in private variables _x and _y.
There are methods def x and def y for accessing the private data.
def x_= and def y_= are for validating and setting the value of _x and _y.
Notice the special syntax for the setters:
the method has _= appended to the identifier of the getter and the parameters come after.
 */

/*
Primary constructor parameters with val and var are public.
However, because vals are immutable, you canâ€™t write the following.

class Point(val x: Int, val y: Int)
val point = new Point(1, 2)
point.x = 3  // <-- does not compile

Parameters without val or var are private values, visible only within the class.
class Point(x: Int, y: Int)
val point = new Point(1, 2)
point.x  // <-- does not compile
