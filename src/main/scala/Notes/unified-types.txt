Any:
- AnyVal
  - Double, Float, Long, Int, Short, Byte, Unit, Boolean, Char
- AnyRef
  - List, Option, YourClass
    - Null (inherit the above 3)

Nothing inherits Null and all classes under AnyVal

Unit is a value type which carries no meaningful information.
There is exactly one instance of Unit which can be declared literally like so: ().
All functions must return something so sometimes Unit is a useful return type.

casting is uni-directional:
- Char to Int
- Byte -> Short -> Int -> Long -> Float -> Double
