Traits are used to share interfaces and fields between classes.
They are similar to Java 8â€™s interfaces.
Classes and objects can extend traits but traits cannot be instantiated and
therefore have no parameters.

The trait Pet has an abstract field name which gets implemented by Cat and Dog in their constructors.
On the last line, we call pet.name which must be implemented in any subtype of the trait Pet.
